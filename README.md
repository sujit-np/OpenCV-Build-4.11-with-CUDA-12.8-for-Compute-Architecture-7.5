# OpenCV-Build-4.11-with-CUDA-12.8-for-Compute-Architecture-7.5
This repository features a custom build of OpenCV compiled with CUDA 12.8 support targeting the 7.5 architecture. It includes the fully integrated opencv_world binary along with all OpenCV contrib modules, such as the efficient FastMatch and CUDA-accelerated fast matrix operations. Both Debug and Release configurations are present.

What’s included

opencv_world unified library for simplified linking and deployment across modules.

All opencv_contrib modules enabled via OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH during build.

CUDA-enabled build tuned for arch bin 7.5 (Turing family like RTX 20xx).

FastMatch enabled, suitable for high-speed feature matching workflows.

CUDA fast math enabled for higher throughput when small precision trade-offs are acceptable.

Prebuilt Debug and Release variants.

Artifacts

Libraries: opencv_world and associated binaries for the configured toolchain.

Configs: Debug and Release folders with corresponding libraries and CMake files.

Optional extras: pkg-config/cmake config files if generated, plus versioned build information.

System requirements

NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 7.5 recommended; newer architectures may run but are not specifically targeted by this build.

NVIDIA Driver compatible with CUDA 12.8.

CUDA Toolkit 12.8 installed on the target system.

Optional: cuDNN for accelerated DNN inference if using the dnn module.

Quick start (C++)

Install CUDA 12.8 runtime and ensure the NVIDIA driver is up to date.

Add the library bin directory to PATH (Windows) or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux).

Link against opencv_world in CMake:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)
project(MyCVApp CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

Adjust to your install path
set(OpenCV_DIR "<path-to-this-repo>/install")
find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_app src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE ${OpenCV_LIBS})

Build and run.

Verify CUDA enablement at runtime:

C++
#include <opencv2/core.hpp>
#include <opencv2/core/cuda.hpp>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
std::cout << cv::getBuildInformation() << std::endl;
std::cout << "CUDA devices: " << cv::cuda::getCudaEnabledDeviceCount() << std::endl;
return 0;
}

Using contrib features and FastMatch

Popular contrib modules available include aruco, bgsegm, xfeatures2d, ximgproc, tracking, optflow, surface_matching, and more.

FastMatch is enabled in this build for high-speed feature matching pipelines; integrate it similarly to other contrib features in C++ or through available APIs.

CUDA modules included

CUDA-accelerated modules typically available: cudaarithm, cudaimgproc, cudawarping, cudafeatures2d, cudacodec (if codec dependencies satisfied), and others depending on the final configuration.

CUDA fast math is enabled to favor throughput; assess numeric precision needs before deploying to production-critical applications.

Python note

This repository provides native binaries, not Python wheels.

For Python, ensure environment paths point to these binaries or build a wheel from the provided installation using OpenCV’s Python packaging scripts if required.

Reproducible build notes

Core CMake toggles used (representative):

WITH_CUDA=ON

CUDA_ARCH_BIN=7.5

BUILD_opencv_world=ON

OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=<opencv_contrib/modules>

ENABLE_FAST_MATH=ON or CUDA_FAST_MATH=ON (depending on toolchain/CMake cache variable naming)

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release and Debug

Typical additional flags:

WITH_CUBLAS=ON, WITH_CUFFT=ON

WITH_NVCUVID/NVENC/NVDEC depending on platform and availability

WITH_TBB=ON or WITH_OPENMP=ON if threading libraries are desired

To reproduce, clone opencv and opencv_contrib matching branches, configure with the flags above, and build using Ninja or MSBuild depending on platform.

Installation

Linux:

Copy libs and share/cmake/OpenCV* config files to a preferred prefix (e.g., /opt/opencv-cuda-12.8).

Add lib path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and run ldconfig if installing system-wide.

Windows:

Copy bin and lib directories to a stable path (e.g., C:\opencv\cuda-12.8).

Add bin path to the system PATH.

Point CMake’s OpenCV_DIR to the install folder.

Verification

Print build info to confirm CUDA and contrib are enabled:

C++:
std::cout << cv::getBuildInformation() << std::endl;

Python:
python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.getBuildInformation()); import cv2 as cv; print('CUDA devices:', cv.cuda.getCudaEnabledDeviceCount())"

Performance tips

Use CUDA streams and batch operations to maximize GPU utilization.

Prefer pinned host memory for high-throughput transfers where applicable.

Test with realistic workloads to validate fast math precision trade-offs.

For feature matching workflows, benchmark FastMatch and GPU-based matchers to select the best option for the dataset.

Limitations

This build targets compute 7.5; devices outside this arch may still run but are not the primary optimization target.

Some modules may depend on additional codecs or SDKs that must be present at runtime.

Python wheels are not included; manual packaging is required for Python distribution.
